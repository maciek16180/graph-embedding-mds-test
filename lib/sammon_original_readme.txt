Sammon mapping in Python
========================

-------------
Run sammontest.py() with no arguments to test sammon.py
on Fisher's iris dataset

sammon.py
---------
Simple python implementation of Sammon's non-linear mapping 
algorithm [1]. Perform Sammon mapping on dataset x

y = sammon(x) applies the Sammon nonlinear mapping procedure on
multivariate data x, where each row represents a pattern and each column
represents a feature.  On completion, y contains the corresponding
co-ordinates of each point on the map.  By default, a two-dimensional
map is created.  Note if x contains any duplicated rows, SAMMON will
fail (ungracefully). 

[y,E] = sammon(x) also returns the value of the cost function in E (i.e.
the stress of the mapping).

An N-dimensional output map is generated by y = sammon(x,n) .

A set of optimisation options can be specified using optional
arguments, y = sammon(x,n,[OPTS]):

* maxiter        - maximum number of iterations
* tolfun         - relative tolerance on objective function
* maxhalves      - maximum number of step halvings
* input          - {'raw','distance'} if set to 'distance', X is interpreted as a matrix of pairwise distances.
* display        - 0 to 2. 0 least verbose, 2 max verbose.
* init           - {'pca', 'random'}

The default options are retrieved by calling sammon(x) with no
parameters.
